## Introduction
Emotion detection plays a crucial role in various applications, including human-computer interaction, mental health assessment, and personalized content recommendations. This project aims to build an emotion classifier that can recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.
## Features
- Real-time emotion prediction from images or video frames
- Robust model performance across diverse demographics
- Easy integration with existing applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., emotion_model1.h5)
